# Setup harness

Give every Claude Code session in this repo a fast, measured way to check its own work: `scripts/check.sh` answers "is this change good" at three rungs, Claude Code hooks run the fast rungs on every edit and every stop, and the pre-commit runner holds the commit. The run is explore, present, confirm, write, prove. Nothing is written before the human confirms it as a diff, and nothing third-party is installed before it passes the install check.

The words here are check and prove; "verification" is Ship's word for a real-system check.

**Paths are contracts.** `scripts/check.sh`, `.claude/hooks/check-hook.sh`, `.claude/hooks/cloud-setup.sh` and `docs/agents/harness.md` are read by hooks and by a re-run, and `setup-skills` is to read the profile; write them at exactly those paths. Configuration is committed at project scope (`.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/`, the runner config); anything machine-specific goes to `.claude/settings.local.json`, and the report names it as such.

## Process

### 1. Preconditions: instruct and stop

On any failure print the exact command, then "then rerun `/setup-harness`", and stop.

1. **A git repo with tracked files**, on GitHub or Azure DevOps (`git remote get-url origin`). `curl` and `python3` on `PATH`: this skill's `scripts/pick-version.sh` needs both.
2. **A clean working tree** (`git status --porcelain` empty; else `git stash -u`), so the run's changes are the whole diff and a fix-mode tool rewrites nothing the human has not committed.
3. **Claude Code floor.** Skip this item entirely when `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`. Read `claude --version`. Below the `Floor:` of [templates/harness-profile.md](templates/harness-profile.md), write nothing under `.claude/` in this run, print the upgrade command for the install method (`claude update`; Homebrew `brew upgrade claude-code`; npm `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest`), and stop. The floor is the last release fixing a prompt-cache or context bug that hooks would trigger.
4. **Warn, do not stop**, in the report's header:
   - `claude doctor </dev/null` reports `Auto-updates:` other than `enabled`: name the switch doctor names (`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`, `DISABLE_UPDATES`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`) and the install method's own update command, since Homebrew, WinGet and apt installs do not self-update.
   - The installed version trails its channel's latest: `npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code dist-tags --json` (`latest` and `stable`); name the channel, both versions and the update command.

### 2. The profile

Read `docs/agents/harness.md` if it exists; a repo without one is a first run, and a repo with one is a **re-run**, whose report is the gap report of [reference/gap-report.md](reference/gap-report.md): read it now.

- `Schema:` equal to this skill's `metadata.harness-schema`: read its choices (`## Budgets` overrides, the `## Cloud` verdict and `Allowlist:`, `Excluded:`, `Root:`, `Local-only:` and `Declined:` lines) and honour them without re-asking; a removed `Declined:` line re-opens its proposal, a removed `Root:` line its candidate root's question, a removed `Excluded:` line its fixture tree's question, and a `Local-only:` line whose evidence is gone is offered again (gap-report.md `## Deleted pieces and standing choices`). A `Proof: <sha>` stands or is stale per [reference/cloud.md](reference/cloud.md) `## Recording the proof`.
- `Schema:` behind: read and honour its choices as on an equal schema; the migration is the first, undroppable row of the confirm step, applied entry by entry from [harness-schema.md](harness-schema.md), `Schema:` rewritten last.
- `Schema:` ahead: stop. That repo was set up by a newer setup-harness; print `npx skills add Gharib89/skills --skill setup-harness --agent claude-code -y` and "then rerun `/setup-harness`".

### 3. Explore

Read-only. Collect, then present everything at once in step 4.

1. **Stacks, members and file kinds** per [reference/detection.md](reference/detection.md): read every `catalog/*.md` `## Signals` block first, then scan tracked files only. Read [catalog/README.md](catalog/README.md) once, then each detected entry's file.
2. **Tools per member and role** from the evidence, applying the catalog's yielding rules: the repo's tools are kept and only their gaps filled; a default fills only a role with no evidence.
3. **Surfaces** per [reference/surfaces.md](reference/surfaces.md): each with its member and evidence paths, the behaviour tools it proposes, and whether the repo has a `.claude/skills/run-*/`.
4. **The pre-commit runner** git invokes, per [reference/runner.md](reference/runner.md), and any config that is present but not wired.
5. **Existing harness pieces**: `scripts/check.sh`, `.claude/hooks/`, the `hooks` in `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json`, and a `### Harness` block in `CLAUDE.md`. An existing harness file is the repo's own evidence: compare it with its current template by what it says, keep what it adds and propose only what it lacks ([reference/gap-report.md](reference/gap-report.md) `## Files the skill wrote`).
6. **The install-check rows**: every package, hook repo, binary or vendored plugin the plan adds or re-pins, per [reference/install-check.md](reference/install-check.md), with its version picked by this skill's `scripts/pick-version.sh` and its tier, publisher, provenance and glue read now; a language server's per [reference/language-servers.md](reference/language-servers.md) `## Vendoring` step 1, at the SHA it records. On every run, first or re-run, also every pin already in the repo for a tool the harness runs, per gap-report.md `## Pins`: a first run that skipped one would leave a gap for its own re-run to find.
7. **On a re-run, time the rungs** now, per gap-report.md `## Timing on a re-run`, so the report carries the budgets and any over-budget Offer.
8. **The cloud** per [reference/cloud.md](reference/cloud.md): the verdict's evidence, need by need; an existing cloud `SessionStart` script; the cloud setup's steps, each rung's cloud label, and the static host check over those steps. `origin` on `dev.azure.com` or `visualstudio.com` makes the proof's route Azure DevOps and changes nothing else.

### 4. Present

On a re-run, the gap report in the layout gap-report.md `## The report` gives, each gap under its one disposition. Otherwise one message, in this order:

1. **Header**: skill version, the profile's `Schema:` (and what it migrates to), the Claude Code floor against the installed version (or `skipped: cloud session`), the step-1 warnings, and the surfaces with their evidence paths.
2. **Detection** as detection.md's report lists it.
3. **Questions**, numbered, each with a recommendation: every new fixture tree and every new candidate root ([reference/detection.md](reference/detection.md)), asking excluded or read, and root or ignored, each with the human's reason, every role with two tools and no caller, a runner choice where more than one config has no shim, the cloud verdict with its evidence, each blocked host a step needs (does the environment's Custom allowlist admit it?), the run recipe Offer where surfaces.md makes one, and each question a catalog `Traps:` line asks (js-ts Playwright Test's `webServer.command`).
4. **The install-check table**, glue in full after it, then **Found, not installed** with each refusal's reason.
5. **The writes, as diffs**: runner config additions, the manifest line of each pinned dev dependency, each vendored language server plugin with its `enabledPlugins` line, config files a catalog `Constraints:` or `Traps:` line writes, the `scripts/check.sh` configuration block, `.claude/hooks/check-hook.sh`, the cloud setup's `STEPS` block (or the diff to the repo's own cloud script), the `.claude/settings.json` hook entries, `docs/agents/harness.md` and the `CLAUDE.md` block.

### 5. Confirm

One approval covers the batch: the human answers the questions and may drop rows or writes by number. A candidate root's answer is recorded with the human's reason, a root as `Root: <manifest>: <reason>` and an ignore as `Declined: <manifest> as a root: <reason>`, the form a root with a lockfile takes too when the human drops its `TURN_ROWS` row with a reason; a fixture tree's as `Excluded: <path prefix>: <reason>` or `Declined: <path prefix> as excluded: <reason>`. An answer given without a reason is asked once more before the writes, and one still without a reason acts in this run but is not recorded, so its question is new next run. A row dropped with a reason and an answer keeping a unit off the version the install check picks are each recorded in the profile in the same batch, as `Declined: <what>: <reason>` (`Declined: <unit> <picked version>: <reason>` for the last); a row dropped without a reason is proposed again next run. Re-present only what an answer changed. On a re-run the questions are the gap report's Offers, steps 6 to 8 act on the approved rows and the profile lines the answers record, and step 6's timing is the re-timing of gap-report.md `## Timing on a re-run`.

### 6. Write

In this order, each step's failure stopping the run with its output:

1. **Installs**: each approved unit at its exact pin (a language server whose pin rides in its launch installs nothing here, [reference/language-servers.md](reference/language-servers.md) `## Vendoring` step 4), then the repo's own deps from its lockfile (`uv sync --frozen`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`).
2. **The runner**: its config additions, its install command when git does not yet invoke it (`prek install --allow-missing-config`, [reference/runner.md](reference/runner.md)), then `prek run --all-files` (or the runner's equivalent). A failure here is the repo's code on a tool new to it: report the findings and ask whether to fix them in this run, leave them for the human, or drop the tool; on leave or drop, `git restore` the files its fixes rewrote. Never weaken the tool's config to pass.
3. **`scripts/check.sh`** from [templates/check.sh](templates/check.sh), configuration block filled per [reference/check-ladder.md](reference/check-ladder.md).
4. **Time the rungs** before any hook exists, per check-ladder.md's timing section: each twice, cold reported, warm judged against its budget. A warm `edit` or `turn` over budget gets the narrow / demote / override offer now, and its hook waits until one is applied.
5. **Vendored language servers** per [reference/language-servers.md](reference/language-servers.md) `## Vendoring` steps 2 to 4, at the SHA Explore read.
6. **`.claude/hooks/check-hook.sh`** from [templates/check-hook.sh](templates/check-hook.sh) and the hook entries from [templates/settings-hooks.json](templates/settings-hooks.json), merged beside the repo's own, each `timeout` derived from its budget.
7. **The cloud setup**, cloud-first only, per [reference/cloud.md](reference/cloud.md) `## Writing the cloud setup`: `.claude/hooks/cloud-setup.sh` from [templates/cloud-setup.sh](templates/cloud-setup.sh) (chained after Ship's cloud bootstrap where an entry runs one), or the repo's own cloud script, when it is not that bootstrap, extended in place, and the `SessionStart` entry from [templates/settings-cloud.json](templates/settings-cloud.json).
8. **`docs/agents/harness.md`** from [templates/harness-profile.md](templates/harness-profile.md): `Floor:` and `Location:` as written, every budget `default` unless the human gave an override with a reason, `## Cloud` with the confirmed `Verdict:`, `Setup:` (the cloud setup's path, `None.` when local-only), the human's `Allowlist:`, and `Proof:` kept where step 2 found it standing, else `unproven`, `Local-only:` lines (never a language server's), one for each partial need the cloud verdict found, each MCR no, and each catalog `Local-only:` line a wired `FULL_ROWS` tool carries on a cloud-first repo, so every `LOCAL_ONLY` name has the line whose `<part>` is that name; then the `Excluded:`, `Root:` and `Declined:` lines from the confirm step. Then run `scripts/harness-profile-check.sh docs/agents/harness.md` from this skill's directory; a violation is fixed before continuing.
9. **The `CLAUDE.md` block** from [templates/harness-block.md](templates/harness-block.md), replacing an existing `### Harness` block rather than adding a second.

### 7. Prove

1. `git add --intent-to-add :/`, then `scripts/check.sh full` prints one JSON line and exits 0, or its failures are reported, each `<rung>: fail (<check>)`, as the repo's code or, where the failing content is what this run wrote, as this run's; then, pass or fail, `git reset --quiet`. The runner's `--all-files` checks only files git lists, so without the intent-to-add the files this run created (a new `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/check.sh`, the hooks, the profile) go unchecked until the human's first commit. The tree was clean when the run began and nothing before this step stages, so every untracked file is this run's and the reset leaves the index as the run found it; left in place, the intent-to-add entries would make a re-run's `git stash -u` fail.
2. **The language server proof**, local sessions only, per [reference/language-servers.md](reference/language-servers.md) `## The proof`: `/reload-plugins` asked for when this run wrote a plugin, then an `LSP` hover per wired language.
3. **The cloud proof**, cloud-first only, per [reference/cloud.md](reference/cloud.md) `## The proof`: the local double run, the static host check, then the commit, on GitHub the push the human approves, the printed `claude --cloud` command (on Azure DevOps the `git status` gate over the whole tree first, then `CCR_FORCE_BUNDLE=1`, nothing pushed), and the human's pasted answer, recorded as `Proof: <sha>` in a commit of the profile alone.

### 8. Report

1. The header from step 4.
2. What was written, one line per file, `.claude/settings.local.json` entries named machine-specific.
3. **Language servers**: one line per wired language from the proof, each `local-only`.
4. **Budgets**: one row per rung, cold, warm, budget, verdict (`within`, `over: narrowed`, `over: demoted to <rung>`, `over: override <N>s`, `not judged: fail (<check>)`, `not judged: unavailable (<check>)`, `not judged: contract` on a re-run). Then the **cloud** table: per rung its cloud label and cloud times, and the cloud setup's local double run.
5. **Not acted on**: unclaimed extensions and stacks, unwired tools, Found-not-installed units, `public API: no baseline (<member>)`, `<tool>: <root> not served`, anything "present, not wired".
6. **Standing choices**: every `Excluded:`, `Root:`, `Declined:`, `Local-only:` and override, `Allowlist:`, and the cloud state: `Proof: <sha>`, `cloud: unproven` with what is missing, or `cloud: n/a (local-only: <reason>)`.
7. **Next**: commit the harness files if the proof did not; hooks in `.claude/settings.json` load in new sessions, so start one (or review them in `/hooks`) before relying on them; then `/setup-skills` if the repo uses Ship.
