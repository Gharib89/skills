# GitHub adapter: the host_* interface from _lib.sh over REST via `gh api`.
# REST throughout, retried by the policy on `api` below: gh's GraphQL paths
# (gh pr view --json, gh pr checks --watch) flake 401 mid-session. GraphQL is
# used only for the three things REST lacks, review-thread resolution state,
# resolveReviewThread, and a thread id's reply target (REST offers no route from
# a thread to its first comment), and those keep the flat one retry after 2 s
# that every REST call had before #173. Sourced by _lib.sh's ship_load_host;
# needs SHIP_OWNER and SHIP_REPO set.

R="repos/$SHIP_OWNER/$SHIP_REPO"

# `gh api -i`, with the response status kept and the header block taken back
# out. gh loses the status whenever the error body is empty: a 500 carrying
# Content-Length: 0 surfaces as "unexpected end of JSON input" on stderr, which
# reads like a malformed request rather than a host that is down (#173), so the
# status comes from the response headers `-i` prints instead. Leaves
# SHIP_HTTP_STATUS at the last status line of the response, empty where the call
# got no HTTP answer at all.
#
# The whole response is buffered to split it, which is also what `--paginate`
# means here: gh prints one header block per page, separated from the page
# before it by a blank line, and the status is the last page's.
#
# A header block starts at the top of the response or on that separator, and the
# separator goes out with the block it introduces, so the
# pages concatenate exactly as they do without `-i`. That is the whole defence
# against a body line shaped like a status line: one that does not follow a
# blank line is body, and every caller here reads `--jq` output, one JSON value
# per line, where a blank line does not arise. The status and the body come off
# the one program below, read twice, so a line is body for both or header for
# both: a second rule of its own would be the place the two could disagree.

# A retry has to be the request it retries. `gh api "$@"` carries the argument

# reaches the retry empty and GitHub rejects it as "Body should be a JSON
# object" (#108); buffering it once is what keeps the two byte-identical.
#
# The retry POLICY reads the status `_gh` recovered. A 5xx or a 429 is the host
# and not the payload, and it can outlast a single sleep by minutes (PR #170),
# so it gets a growing backoff, bounded at five attempts and about 30 seconds so
# a genuinely broken call still fails fast. Every other failure, the one 401
# flake this wrapper was written for included, keeps its single retry.
#
# So does a call whose method cannot be repeated, whatever its status. A 5xx can
# be a response lost on the way back from a write that landed, and the wider
# backoff would then repeat the write. GET, PATCH and DELETE are safe to send
# again; POST doubles what it creates, and the one PUT here is the squash merge,
# which must not be attempted five times over 30 s. Those keep exactly the one
# retry they had before #173 rather than gaining four. The method is read from

# to reply to and `poll-pr` already reports `threads: "unavailable"`.
