#   The adapter's PR object: the same fields on both hosts. Comments, review
#   threads and checks come from poll-pr. headings: the body's `## ` section
#   headings, in order (the rule `update-pr-body` reports with). missing: the
#   headings of the profile's `## PR` `Template:` file, read from the checkout
#   root, that the body lacks; [] where there is no profile or the Template: is
#   `None.`, null where its file cannot be read (null is no answer, not a body
#   that lacks nothing). outline_missing: the paths this branch changes against
#   the base (the three-dot diff to HEAD) that the body's `## Change outline`
#   section does not mention, [] when it mentions each. A path is mentioned by
#   its full path or its basename, which a derived copy under `.claude/skills/`
#   shares with its source; `skills-lock.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` are not
#   expected, and a body with no such section misses every path. null where the
#   paths cannot be known: the checkout is not on the PR's head branch, or the
#   base does not resolve (no answer, not an outline that misses nothing).
