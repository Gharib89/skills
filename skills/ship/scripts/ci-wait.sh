# ship phase 8: the expected head, then the conflict check (a conflicted PR has
# no merge ref, so its checks sit pending forever), then a wait until every leg
# check on the head has completed. The wait is bounded twice: by --timeout, the
# window, and by SHIP_CALL_CAP seconds (540), the longest one call holds the
# tool. A window longer than the cap is a chain of calls: the call that would
# pass the cap answers `pending` with a cursor, and `--cursor` resumes it. The
# cursor carries the window's deadline, the expected head (frozen on the first
# pass) and the no-checks grace's clock with the head it started for: a resumed
# call that finds another head starts that clock over.
#
#   ci-wait <pr> [--sha <sha>] [--timeout <s>, at least the no-checks grace the
#           profile leaves standing] [--interval <s>] [--rerun-failed]
#           [--cursor <c>, not with --timeout]
#
# The expected head is `--sha`, else the local HEAD of a checkout of the PR's head
# branch: while the host shows another head the wait grades nothing,
# and a window that closes first is `timeout` carrying the host's head_sha.
#
# Only the profile's Legs: grade the PR. A check belongs to a leg when its name
# is the leg's or starts `<leg> (`, a matrix job. Checks no leg names are
# listed, and one that is red is named, but neither holds the wait nor fails it.
# A profile with no Legs: line leaves every check a leg.
