# The record root is `<git common dir>/ship`: the main checkout and every
# worktree of it resolve the same directory, git never lists it as a working-tree
# file, and it outlives a wiped temp directory, which took the record with it in
# three runs. `--scratchpad <dir>` names another root; outside a git checkout it
# is the only one. Under the root, `ship-<issue>/run.md` is the Run file and
# `scratch-<issue>/` is the run's Scratch directory, which `init` creates and
# returns as `scratch`; the roles' subdirectories are the callers'. `cleanup`
# removes both.
#
# The `--issue` form reads the layout `init` wrote. `init` owns that layout, so
# it is the mechanic that resolves it: a run whose context was compacted still
# has the issue it was invoked on, and called `close` without a path twice for
# want of the rest (#218). An explicit `--file` wins, and neither given is the
# usage error it always was.
#
# `init` writes the ten items and returns them, one per harness task the run
# then creates, and opens phase 0 (`opened`, `mirror`) unless a `--state` states
# the run itself; `--rebuild` with `--state` is the recovery from a Run file a
# subagent overwrote or removed, and `--rebuild` alone replaces the record of an
# issue whose earlier run stopped with a fresh one. A `--state` set holds one
# open phase, or 3 and 4 both, the overlap `open 4` allows. `--from-profile`
# fills `--tripwires`, `--verifications`, `--reviewers` and `--legs` from the
# ship profile (the `Tripwires:` line under `## Local gate`, the `###` headings
# under `## Verification` and `## Reviewers`, the leg names under `## CI`); a
# flag given beside it wins. Each `###` heading under `## Verification` is one
# Verification name whatever it holds, spaces and punctuation included, except
# `=`, which `--result` splits on. A flip returns the `mirror` value for that
# phase's task, and `next <n>` is the close of the one open phase and the open
# of <n> in one call, refused whole when either half would be. `open 4` is the
# one open admitted while phase 3 is open, the overlap the run has; any other
# open over an open phase is refused.
# Below the checklist it writes sections the run fills: `Verification results`
# where `--from-profile` took the names from the profile's headings, or
# `--verifications` names a comma list of name-shaped words (one
# `- <name>: pending` each, which `close 3 --result <name>=<word>` settles with
# one of pass, fail, deferred-to-ci, unavailable, unexercised or n/a, and which
# `close 3` will not pass while any is pending), then `Design and plan`,
# `Deviations log`, and `Direct reads`, one line per informational read the run
# made straight through the host's REST form, no mechanic covering it, so one
# that recurs across runs is visible as a mechanic to promote. `gate record`
# appends the local gate's verdict, the head it ran on and the verdict JSON's
# `gates` object (compact, one line, absent when the JSON has none) to a
# `Local gate` section; `gate read` answers whether the head the run is at is
# still the one that verdict covers, and returns the gates the merge gate cites
# when it does not re-run the gate. Both take `--head` as a full or abbreviated
# sha, 7 to 64 hex digits.
#
# `close 4` and `close 7` hold the self-review and the review loop to the
# evidence they leave in the Run file. They are completeness guards: they check
# that each line is present and in its shape, and the self-review keeps the
# judgment of what a line says. Two lines are produced, written by the verb that
# ran the proof: the red `Reverted-fix:` line by `prove` and the `Probe:` line by
# `probe`. Every other line is attested, written by the run and taken at its
# word. A refused close writes nothing, names everything missing in one message,
# and `next` over either phase is held the same way. A gate line is a line anywhere in the file, an optional leading
# `- ` accepted, matched by exact prefix at the line start. `close 4` reads the
# checkout's own diff (the working tree, untracked files included, against the
# merge base of HEAD and origin/HEAD) and asks `dropped-lines`; it needs:
#   `Reverted-fix: <test path>: red at <sha> reverting <path>...` (produced) or
#     `Reverted-fix: <test path>: n/a: <reason>` (attested) for each test file
#     the diff adds or changes, deletions aside. A red line stands while neither
#     the test nor a path it lists has changed since <sha> in the working tree,
#     untracked files included; a hand-written `red` or `red: <text>` is
#     refused. A test file has a path component `tests`, `test` or `__tests__`,
#     or a basename matching `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_test.*` or `test_*`.
#   `Dropped: <id> re-homed at <path>` or `Dropped: <id> dropped on purpose:
#     <why>` for each block `dropped-lines` reports, <id> being its `id`.
#   a near-miss table for each added or changed `*.sh` outside the tests whose
#     added lines hold a pattern matcher (a heuristic: `=~`, a `grep` or `egrep`
#     command, or a regex literal in an `awk` or `sed` line, comment lines
#     aside): one `Near-miss: <script>: <kind>: <test path>` (a file in the
#     checkout) or `Near-miss: <script>: <kind>: n/a: <reason>` per kind, or one
#     `Near-miss: <script>: n/a: <reason>` for the script. The kinds are
#     partial-token (a near-miss token that must not match), quoted (the token
#     inside a comment, a code span or a quote), indented (indented or nested
#     input), unbalanced (unbalanced input) and unreadable (unreadable input,
#     which must exit 2).
#   every `Probe:` line in the produced shape,
#     `Probe: <ref>: <command> => exit <n> at <sha>: <last output line>`.
#   every `Declined: <ref>: <kind>: <reason>` carrying its kind, `claim` or
#     `judgment`, and a nonblank reason; <ref> is the text before the first
#     `: `. A `claim:` decline needs a produced `Probe: <ref>:` line, a
#     `judgment:` one needs none, and the reason's words decide nothing.
# `close 7` reads the reviewers from the phase's checklist row (nothing is held
# where the row names none, or names what is not a list of names) and needs a
# `Stop: <reviewer>: <reason>` for each, the last such line deciding, the reason
# one of cap, tree unchanged, small lane, auto-once or not reviewed, and unless
# it is `not reviewed` at least one `Round: <reviewer> <n>: <text>`, <n> a
# positive integer. `grade` writes `Grade: <word>` under the `## Grade` section,
# replacing the line a call before it wrote.
#
# `prove` runs the sibling `revert-red` on <test> and its <path>s. On its exit 0
# it appends `Reverted-fix: <test>: red at <sha> reverting <path>...` under
# `## Evidence`, <sha> the HEAD revert-red ran on; on its exit 1 or 2 it writes
# nothing and exits with that code, passing revert-red's answer through. A
# reverted path holding whitespace is refused, since the line could not be read
# back. `probe` runs <command> as argv, never through a shell string, at the
# checkout top with stdin from /dev/null, and appends
# `Probe: <ref>: <command> => exit <n> at <sha>: <last output line>` under
# `## Evidence`, the last nonblank line of stdout and stderr together, or
# `(no output)`. It exits 0 whatever the command's exit; a ref holding `: ` names
# no decline and is refused.
#
# Reaches no host, except through the command `probe` is given, which may. It
# writes only the record root; `close 4` reads the checkout's git state and runs
# the sibling `dropped-lines` mechanic, `prove` the sibling `revert-red`, and a
# read that fails is exit 2, never a clean diff.
