# Candidate check. Before creating, the mechanic lists the host's open issues
# and compares titles: lowercased, punctuation as a separator, tokens under
# four characters and generic English stopwords dropped. An open issue sharing
# three or more tokens with the new title is a candidate, and with any
# candidate the mechanic files nothing, so consecutive runs meeting the same
# adjacent find cannot file it twice. `--distinct-from` names the numbers the
# caller has read and judged different, and files past them.
#
# The list is the host's own, and GitHub's serves a just-created issue a few
# seconds late, so two calls seconds apart can both file. The caller handles
# that one itself, and cheaply: a run already knows what it just filed. The
# check is for the same find met by a later run, minutes or days on.
