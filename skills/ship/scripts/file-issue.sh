# --repo files at that GitHub repo instead of the origin's: a Ship defect, at
# the source repo, on the human's word (ADR 0004). Its host is probed first,
# and every exit 1 under it, the probe's or a refused write's, carries the
# command to run by hand as `command`.
#
# In-diff check. Without --repo, on a branch other than the base, a title or body
# citing a path the branch already changes (the diff from the merge base to the
# working tree) is the PR's own work, not an adjacent find: nothing is filed, and
# the answer lists the paths as `in_diff`. --outside-scope "<reason>" skips the
# check, for a find that is really another defect in the same file; the reason
# is the caller's own record and rides back as `outside_scope`, not into the
# issue. A path counts as cited as a whole token wherever it sits, a code span or
# a quote included (ship_paths_cited), so a prefix of a changed path is no
# citation. On the base branch, detached, or where the base does not resolve
# there is no diff to compare and no check. Under --repo the find is another
# repo's and the check is skipped.
#
# Candidate check. Before creating, the mechanic lists the host's open issues
# and compares titles: lowercased, punctuation as a separator, tokens under
# four characters and generic English stopwords dropped. An open issue sharing
# three or more tokens with the new title is a candidate, and with any
# candidate the mechanic files nothing, so consecutive runs meeting the same
# adjacent find cannot file it twice. `--distinct-from` names the numbers the
# caller has read and judged different, and files past them.
#
# The list is the host's own, and GitHub's serves a just-created issue a few
# seconds late, so two calls seconds apart can both file. The caller handles
# that one itself, and cheaply: a run already knows what it just filed. The
# check is for the same find met by a later run, minutes or days on.
#
# stdout: {"filed": true, "number": <n>, "url": "<url>", "outside_scope": "<reason>"}

#         {"error": "...", "in_diff": [<path>]} on exit 1, the find cites a changed path
