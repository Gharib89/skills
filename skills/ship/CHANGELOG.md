# CHANGELOG

Every entry here is written by the release run on main, which grades the bump
from the squash subject's Conventional-Commit type and cuts one entry per
released version. See
[docs/adr/0003-version-and-changelog-cut-on-merge.md](https://github.com/Gharib89/skills/blob/main/docs/adr/0003-version-and-changelog-cut-on-merge.md).

The release run writes new entries above this note, counting on from 0.11.4. See [ADR 0005](https://github.com/Gharib89/skills/blob/main/docs/adr/0005-skills-stay-0x-until-public-release.md).
