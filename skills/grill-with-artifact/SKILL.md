# grill-with-artifact

Grilling, with a page as the surface. Call the Skill tool twice, for `grilling`
and `domain-modeling`: they own the design tree, the frontier, "facts are your
job" and every glossary and ADR write. With either one not installed, print
these for the human and stop:

```sh
npx skills@1.8.1 add mattpocock/skills#a496f5513d4a4cf889bc48e189e579f4b0bdf6aa --skill grilling --agent claude-code -y
npx skills@1.8.1 add mattpocock/skills#d81f3a183412e71a5b1e84ca21bc1a35eea03a60 --skill domain-modeling --agent claude-code -y
```

This skill replaces only two things in them: how a
**grilling round** is shown (a round document on the page, never the chat
format `grilling` gives) and how the answers come back (a Submit on the page).

The page is [page.html](page.html) with its style and script siblings, fixed
and tested: a session fills its title and publishes it once. From then on
every grilling round is a document in the page's database, and the page renders
it live. [round-data.md](round-data.md) is the contract between the two: read
it before writing round 1, and hold every document you write to its field
table and its figure style contract.

## 1 · Pick the surface

The page needs the `Artifact`, `ArtifactData` and `ArtifactComments` tools.
With any of them missing, or when the human says the page cannot reach its
database, print one line, `No artifact surface here, so this session runs in
the chat.`, and run the rest of the session as `grilling` and
`domain-modeling` describe. Skip the rest of this file.

**Done when:** the session is on the page, or the one line is printed and the
chat format runs.

## 2 · Publish the page

1. Take the topic from the invocation. A wayfinder `grilling` ticket's Notes
   invoke this skill: the ticket's title is the topic and its body is the first
   frontier's context. Only when no topic was given, ask the human for one in a
   few words.
2. Copy `page.html` and its siblings (`page.css`, `page-core.js`,
   `page-boot.js`) into your scratchpad as `grill-<topic-slug>/` and replace
   the one `{{TOPIC}}` in `page.html` only with the topic, HTML-escaped (`&`,
   `<`, `>`, `"`).
3. Publish `page.html` as a new artifact, the siblings in `files`:
   `capabilities` `{"db": {}, "user": {}, "comments": {}}`, `icon` `question`,
   and a one sentence `description` naming what is being grilled. Each session
   gets its own artifact. Refused: print step 1's line and fall back.
4. Read the publish result's subscription line. The Submit wake reaches you
   only while the artifact's watch shows auto-replies armed. A line saying
   there is no live subscription, or a session with `T3CODE_THREAD_ID` set
   (T3 Code's messages carry no human origin, so nothing arms), is unarmed from
   the first publish. When the line leaves it in doubt, check with
   `ArtifactComments` `watch` and no `url`.
5. Print the page link, and whether the wake is armed. Unarmed, say in the same
   reply that the human types `submitted` in this chat after each Submit.

**Done when:** the link is printed, and the reply says whether Submit wakes
the session.

## 3 · Post a grilling round

1. Compute the frontier as `grilling` says.
2. Draw the design tree as `treeSvg`, every decision a node in its state, each
   open node carrying `data-q` for its question, and the `hot` path named in
   `treeCaption`. Where a mechanism or a comparison is faster seen than read,
   add a question's `figureSvg`. Both follow the figure style contract in
   [round-data.md](round-data.md). The first figure loads `artifact-diagramming`
   through the Skill tool; the contract's classes win over its colours. Without
   that skill the round goes out with no figures and stays on the page.
3. Fill `settled` with one entry per question the previous round asked, and
   `docsWritten` with every glossary term and ADR written from its answers:
   both are empty arrays in round 1.
4. Write the round with `ArtifactData` `set`, collection `rounds`, doc id the
   round number.
5. Resolve the Submit thread that started this turn, if one did, so an open
   thread always means still working. Then print one status line,
   `Round <n> posted. Questions: <k>.`, and end the turn. The questions and
   what settled them live on the page only.

**Done when:** `rounds/<n>` is written, the turn's Submit thread is resolved,
and the status line is the turn's only text.

## 4 · Read a Submit

The Submit comment is a **doorbell**: the one page action that starts a turn in
this session. It arrives as a comment on the watched artifact, sent to Claude.
A `submitted` typed in the chat rings the same bell.

1. Read `answers/round-<n>` with `ArtifactData` `get`. With no such document,
   take the answers from the comment's text, whose lines round-data.md's
   **Answers text** lists; a pasted answers text in the chat is the same
   text. A comment carrying no answers
   is the human talking: answer it in the chat, resolve its thread, and end
   the turn.
2. Apply each answer as `grilling` and `domain-modeling` say, writing any term
   or ADR it settles now, in the repo. One rule differs: `domain-modeling` only
   offers an ADR, and here the session writes it once the decision meets the
   three conditions of `domain-modeling`'s "Offer ADRs sparingly", because the
   Submit is the human's approval and an offer would cost another round. A
   reopen or a Not yet edits the ADR.
3. **Defer** puts the question back in the next round with `carriedFrom`
   reason `deferred`. **Reopen** (each id in `answers.reopen`) puts a settled
   question back with reason `reopened` and its answer as `earlier`. Recompute
   which later decisions rested on it: carry back each one now on the frontier,
   and mark the rest `n-blocked` in the tree.
4. Post the next grilling round (step 3). The platform's own reply in the
   Submit thread is the receipt; add none of your own.

**Done when:** every answer is applied and the next round is posted.

## 5 · Close

When the frontier is empty, post a closing round: `kind` `closing`, with
`summary` holding every decision under a few headings, and its status line
reads `Round <n> posted. Closing summary.` The page shows Confirm and Not yet,
and no Reopen: a Not yet comment names what to reopen.

- **Not yet**: grill its comment as a new frontier from step 3.
- **Confirm**: resolve its thread, resolve a wayfinder ticket (below), print
  exactly `Session confirmed. Decisions: <k>. Docs written: <m>.`, and end the
  turn.

Any outward-facing step (filing issues, writing a spec) waits for the Confirm
and for the human to ask for it. A wayfinder ticket is the exception: on the
Confirm, resolve it with the Resolve operation in the repo's
`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` (comment the closing summary, close the
ticket, append the context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far), with no
further ask, since the ticket exists to be closed by this session. A next
command the Skill tool cannot run, such as `/to-spec`, is named for the human to
type.

**Done when:** the human pressed Confirm, its thread is resolved, any wayfinder
ticket is resolved, and the confirmed line is the turn's only text.
