# .claude/hooks/cloud-setup.sh: this repo's cloud setup, written by
# setup-harness. A `SessionStart` hook in .claude/settings.json runs it in every
# Claude Code on the web session, on start and on resume, so every tool
# scripts/check.sh runs is installed before the session's first edit.
#
# stdout: one line, `harness cloud setup: ok` or `harness cloud setup: FAILED
#         <step>`, because a failed or timed-out SessionStart never stops the
#         session and this line is the session's only sign of it
# stderr: each step's own output
# exit:   0 ok, or not a cloud session · 1 a step failed
#
# Idempotent: a resumed session keeps its disk and runs this again, so a step
# whose done test passes is skipped and the second run is a fast no-op. Only
# routes the cloud sandbox's network passes belong here (apt, the package
# registries), or a host the environment's Custom allowlist admits (the harness
# profile's `Allowlist:`).

# must itself be a fast no-op when there is nothing to do (`uv sync --frozen`).
