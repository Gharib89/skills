# Two transports, chosen by the profile's `Request:` line, never by the brand.
# Default, `Request: None.`: the host's own request-a-reviewer call. With
# `--comment <phrase>`, from `Request: comment <phrase>`: the phrase is posted as
# a PR comment, which is how a reviewer that is a comment-triggered workflow is
# asked for a round. The host has no reviewer to add for that one, so there is
# nothing to read back off a requested-reviewers list; `host_pr_comment` posts
# and verifies, and the verified comment is the read-back.
#
# `requested_at` is the ISO-8601 time of the review_requested event the
# read-back found, or the wall clock where the host records no event time, or,
# under the comment transport, the host's own creation time for that comment.
# Phase 7 passes it to `poll-pr --since` so the round counts on whatever head it
# lands on. The host's clock and not this machine's, because a local clock
# running ahead would put `since` in the future and strand the round it asked for.
#
# stdout: {pr, login, requested, readback[], requested_at, transport}
# exit: 0 requested and read back · 1 not read back (never-queued after one retry) · 2 usage
