# CI tests the merge ref, so a branch that predates a merge still goes green,
# while every "does this already exist in the repo?" answer taken from this
# worktree was pre-merge. Pure git, host-neutral, run inline before the local
# gate and after every conflict resolution.

# exit: 0 fresh · 1 behind (rebase, then re-run) · 2 the base could not be resolved
#   An unresolvable base fails: a check that could not ask its question must
#   not answer "fresh". Offline is fine (the last-known ref still compares).
