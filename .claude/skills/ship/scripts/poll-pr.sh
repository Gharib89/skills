# ship phases 7 and 8: one bounded, foreground poll of a PR's head, checks,
# reviews and threads, then ONE JSON summary.
#
#   poll-pr <pr> [--reviewer <name> [--since <iso>]] [--brief, or --brief --full <id>[,<id>]]
#           [--timeout <s>] [--interval <s>]
#
# `--reviewer <name>` names the `### <name>` block under the profile's
# `## Reviewers`, read before any host is reached; `ship_reviewer_derive` answers
# the login, the landing rule, the run to await and the default `--timeout`, which
# a `--timeout` given overrides. The derivation comes back on `reviewer`: {name,
# login, rule, await_run, timeout}, null without the flag.
#
# done when the PR is in conflict (merge-ref checks stay unstarted, so waiting is
# pointless), or every check on the head has completed and, with --reviewer, a
# SUBSTANTIVE review by that reviewer's login has landed. `substantive` is the landing
# signal, set by the host adapter's reviews projection: an empty row and a
# notice-only row are rows, not rounds.
#
# Two landing rules, derived from the reviewer's profile `Trigger:`; `landed_by`
# names the one that matched.
#   head (on-push): the review sits on the current head. Every push
#     earns a new review, so a review on an older commit does not count.
#   since (on-request and auto-once, from --since): the review was submitted at or
#     after <iso>, on ANY head. Such a reviewer delivers one round per request
#     and posts it once, so a push between the request and the review leaves
#     the round keyed to the older head, where the head rule would wait out the
#     whole window. Pass `request-review`'s `requested_at` or `open-pr`'s
#     `created_at`. Matching by time rather than by requesting login is
#     deliberate: the login a request is made under and the login the host
#     records can differ. A row with a null submitted_at is host state rather
#     than a timed event (an Azure DevOps vote, which the API leaves
#     unstamped): it cannot answer a question about time, so it satisfies the
#     head rule only.
#     Counting it here would land round 2 instantly off round 1's stale vote.
#
# Each review row carries the round's own `body` and the `id` the host knows it
# by, clipped past 2000 characters and marked "...[truncated]" there: phase 7
# triages from the body, and a round whose findings are in it rather than in
# threads is invisible without it. `--brief --full` names the ids to return whole;
# every other row stays clipped, and an id matching no row changes nothing.
# `threads[]` rows carry the thread's first comment, which `reply-thread` answers,
# and `replied`, true once this identity has answered in that thread.
#
# Under a comment transport the poll awaits the workflow run named by the
# block's `Workflow:`, the run that reviewer's round comes from, before the
# window may report that reviewer silent.
# Such a run is attached to the default branch's SHA, so `checks` cannot see it,
# and the one signal left was the absence of a review. Awaiting it, the window
# is the RUN's lifetime and `--timeout` only its floor: a run that has not
# finished keeps the poll going, and the ceiling the usage line states is the
# bound on what the run may add, so a `--timeout` past it is the caller's own
# window, which the run then extends by nothing. A run that concluded successfully buys one more
# interval for the row to appear; one that concluded any other way closes the
# window there and then, whatever `--timeout` had left, carrying its URL, which
# the review loop reads as `infra-error` rather than `silent`, or, where the
# conclusion is `skipped`, as the workflow declining the comment. A run still live when the ceiling closes
# is reported as it stands, status and URL, and reads as `infra-error` too: a
# run that outlived the ceiling delivered nothing either. The run is reported on
# `reviewer_run`: null where no run is awaited, `{status, conclusion, url}`
# otherwise, with status `none` and the other two null where no run was created
# at all, and the string
# "unavailable" where the host could not answer the read, the way `threads`
# reports one it could not read. An unavailable read leaves the window at the
# constant and that reviewer's exit is `unreachable` rather than `silent`,
# because a read that did not happen is no evidence about the reviewer. The run
# read is keyed by `--since`, the request the run should follow. Which event
# starts such a run is the host's word and the adapter's business: this
# mechanic names the workflow file and the instant, and nothing else.
#
# `reviewer_blocked` non-null with done=false means the round is WAITING (a
# quota or rate-limit notice), not missing. It is read from the awaited login's
# review bodies as well as its PR comments: a reviewer states a notice on either
# surface, and both are read. `threads` is "unavailable" when thread
# state could not be read (GraphQL refused): that reviewer's exit is degraded
# unreachable, the run proceeds.
#
# `--brief` projects that same JSON, from the same single fetch, down to what a
# review loop acts on: head, mergeable, `landed_by`, one row per reviewer round
# (id, submitted_at, substantive, and the body cut to its finding items) and one
# row per OPEN thread (id, path, lead, resolved, replied). `--full` names the
# rows that come back whole, so `--brief --full <id>` is the summary with that
# one round verbatim. Rounds come from `all[]` under the
# --since rule and `on_head[]` under the head rule, the list that rule lands
# from, and the run's own rows drop out: a thread reply of ours posts as a review
# row of its own, and a convergence test that counts it reads its own voice as
# the reviewer's. That drop needs the host identity, so `--brief` asks for it up
# front and exits 2 when the host cannot answer, rather than returning a list it
# cannot promise is the reviewer's alone. The full shape stays the default.
