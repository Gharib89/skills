# Watching and reconciling

What `watch.sh` and `reconcile.sh` count as a change or a stall. Their `--help`
lists the fields; this file holds the rules behind them.

## Watch

- A finished run is reported only if it is still at rest `--recheck` seconds
  later (default 90): a run awaiting its own subagent restarts.
- `stall-window` is an entry at rest with no new run for `--stall-window`
  seconds (default 900).
- It re-reads the ledger each poll, and skips an entry `reconcile` has not
  observed yet (`unobserved`).
- One watcher runs per ledger: a second start exits 1 with `running`, and the
  first is left alone.

## Stalls

- A stall (a completed run with no merged PR and no merge-gate summary, or a
  window passed with no new run) adds 1.
- A real step (a run ending in the merge-gate summary, or a PR opened) takes 1
  off, never below 0.
- An entry at 3 stalls gains none.
- `stalled` holds one `{key, thread, stalls, reason}` per stall counted now.
