# How Ship lands a pull request
language: en
narrator: am_fenrir

## Scene hook · The promise

### Narration
1. Ship opens {42|forty two} pull requests, each one `merged`. [ex-3]
2. Here is how. [no-claim]

### Visual
```json
{ "component": "title", "props": { "kicker": "Ship", "title": "Issue to pull request" } }
```
````

- **Header.** Only `language`, `narrator` and `style`. `language` defaults to
  `en`; `narrator` and `style` are optional.
  With a brief in the run folder, compile takes all three from it and refuses
  a header key that names another value.
- **Scenes.** `## Scene <id> · <title>`, the id kebab-case and not `main`,
  then optionally `role: <role> · <n> s` (see Script), which the script gates
  need.
- **Narration.** Numbered sentences in spoken form; an indented line continues
  the sentence above, so its cites go on the last line. `{written|spoken}`
  shows the written form in the captions and voices the spoken one; backticks
  are dropped. A caption breaks only between written tokens, so each holds at
  most 84 characters. Every sentence ends in `[a, b]`, its cites, or in
  `[no-claim]` when it makes no claim.
- **Visual.** One JSON block per scene, one component, required props marked
  `*`. `at` is a sentence number: that item rises in, or that change plays, as
  the sentence starts.
  - `title` (`kicker`, `title*`, `subtitle`).
  - `cards` (`items*`, each `at*`, `label*`, `value*`, `note`).
  - `terminal` (`title`, `lines*`, each `at*`, `text*`).
  - `flow`: a chain of 2 to 5 steps joined by arrows (`steps*`, each `at*`,
    `label*`, `note`).
  - `panels`: 2 or 3 side by side (`items*`, each `at*`, `title*`, `body*`).
  - `list`: 1 to 6 points (`title`, `items*`, each `at*`, `text*`).
  - `code`: a highlighted code frame (`lang*`, a Shiki language id; `code*`,
    one string with `\n` between lines, at most 12 lines; `file`;
    `highlights`, each `at*` and `lines*`, `[first, last]` counted from 1).
    The highlights draw only when the style profile's `effects` lists
    `highlight`; otherwise they are dropped with no error.
  - `codediff`: a code frame that turns `before*` into `after*` at `at*`, the
    removed lines closing and the added ones opening (`lang*`, `file`; each
    side one string like `code`, at most 12 lines).

## Style profiles

Style profiles are looked up in three stores, first match winning: the
project's `explainers/.styles/`, the user config store's `styles/`, and the
skill's bundled `<skill>/styles/`. The header's `style:` names one; without it,
the first store holding a `default` file (one profile name) decides, else
`claude-code`. A run copies its profile to `<run>/style.json` and keeps using
that copy, so a later edit to a store never changes this video; delete the
copy to take up the edit, or name another profile in `style:`. Two profile
keys choose how diagrams and code frames draw: `look`, `clean` (the default) or
`sketch`, which outlines flow steps and panels by hand, seeded per scene and
element so a render repeats exactly; and `effects`, the ones a video may use,
from `draw` (flow arrows stroke on) and `highlight` (code lines a sentence
names). A profile with no `effects` allows none, and one it leaves out never
reaches the video. The score's sound effects are separate: `effects` never
mutes them. A profile's `motion` is `rise` or `spring`
(see [style.md](style.md)).
